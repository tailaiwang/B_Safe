Abandon all your equipment. Debris can hit you in the churning sea of snow.
If possible, try to shelter behind rocks, trees or vehicles. 
If caught in the open, try to ¡°swim¡± through the snow and avoid debris. 
Be aware of dangerous terrain features, like cliffs and boulders. 
As the snow nears you, take in a deep breath and cover your nose and mouth.
Thrust, kick and swim to stay on the surface. 
Ride on top of the snow, and attempt to get to the edge of the avalanche.
Do not open your mouth as the snow hits you, it can fill your airways
Bring your hands up to your face to make an air space.
