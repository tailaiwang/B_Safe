B Safe is an app developped by B-House Design, to help Canadians become more resilient against Natural Disasters. We see that many Canadians are undereducated about Natural Disasters, and at the same time many people find it difficult to think logically during times of high stress. B Safe will solve both these problems by providing users with a friendly User Interface that will walk them through customizable natural disaster guides. The user will be faced with voice prompts, simple instructions, and images that will assist them through the entire survival process.
